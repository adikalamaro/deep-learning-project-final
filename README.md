Brain Tumor Detection and Classification from MRI Scans
Overview
This repository contains code and resources for a deep learning project focused on detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI scans using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), transfer learning, and segmentation techniques.

Project Components
MRI Scans: The dataset consists of MRI scans, providing detailed images of the brain's internal structures.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNN architectures are employed to automatically extract relevant features from MRI scans.

Transfer Learning: Pre-trained CNN models (e.g., VGG, ResNet, Inception) are utilized to leverage learned features and enhance model performance.

Segmentation: Segmentation techniques are applied to precisely locate and delineate brain tumor regions within MRI scans.

Classification: Tumor regions, identified through segmentation, are classified into different types or malignancy levels, providing valuable insights to medical professionals.

Model Evaluation: Performance assessment is conducted using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to gauge the effectiveness of tumor detection and classification.

Usage
Data Preparation: Organize MRI scan dataset in a structured manner and ensure proper labeling.

Transfer Learning: Select a pre-trained CNN model and fine-tune it on the MRI dataset.

Segmentation: Implement segmentation techniques to isolate brain tumor regions within MRI scans.

Classification: Train a classification model to categorize tumor regions based on type or malignancy level.

Evaluation: Assess model performance using evaluation metrics and visualize results.
